# Sudoku

This is a simple Sudoku game on a 9x9 board that checks the conditions listed below:

1) Each row of the board must contain all digits from 1 to 9 (the order doesn't matter);
2) Each column of the board must contain all digits from 1 to 9 (again, the order doesn't matter);
3) Each of the nine 3x3 "tiles" (or "sub-squares") of the table must contain all digits from 1 to 9.

## Rules

You must input a sample of 9 digits for each row in order to proceed.
If your samples match all the conditions, the script will output if it's valid.
